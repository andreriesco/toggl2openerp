# toggl2openerp
Quick and dirty Python script to convert a Toggl report to CSV in a format that is compatible for importing into OpenERP 6.

# Toggl usage

In Toggl, use the Analytical Account name as **Project**, the Analytical Account ID as **Client** and the Product (e.g. GRCost99) as **Tag**. A typical entry in the Toggl web interface will look like this:

# Using the script

Call the script with two arguments: the CSV report obtained from Toggl (from Reports -> Detailed -> Download CSV) and the name of the timesheet output to be created. E.g.:

```shell
$ python3 toggl2openerp.py Toggl_time_entries_2019-11-01_to_2019-11-30.csv timesheets_november.csv
```

# Importing into OpenERP

Open your timesheet in the OpenERP client, click **Import Timesheet Lines** and point to the CSV file generated by the script. Check your timesheet, save and confirm.
